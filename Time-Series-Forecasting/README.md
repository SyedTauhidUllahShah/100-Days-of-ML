# Time Series Forecasting Resources

In the [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/sarthakbatragatech/100-Days-of-ML/tree/master/Data-Wrangling) section, some transformations were performed over 2 years of sales data from the Russian software company, 1C. In this module, we will dive deep into the dataset with the aim of solving the related Kaggle Challenge related to predicting future sales.

## The Challenge

We are provided with daily historical sales data. The task is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set. Note that the list of shops and products slightly changes every month. Creating a robust model that can handle such situations is part of the challenge.
