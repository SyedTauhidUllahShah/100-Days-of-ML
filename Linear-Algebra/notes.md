    - An entity with both magnitude and direction. Velocity is a vector while speed is a scalor.
- [ ] Linear combinations and spans
- [ ] Linear dependence and independence
- [ ] Subspaces and the basis for a subspace
- [ ] Vector dot and cross products
- [ ] Matrices for solving systems by elimination
- [ ] Null space and column space

### Matrix transformations
- [ ] Functions and linear transformations
- [ ] Linear transformation examples
- [ ] Transformations and matrix multiplication
- [ ] Inverse functions and transformations
- [ ] Finding inverses and determinants
- [ ] More determinant depth
- [ ] Transpose of a matrix

### Alternate coordinate systems (bases)
- [ ] Orthogonal complements
- [ ] Orthogonal projections
- [ ] Change of basis
- [ ] Orthonormal bases and the Gram-Schmidt process
- [ ] Eigen-everything
